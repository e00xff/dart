# Question 1: What is encryption?
- Making data secure (*)
- Randomly changin data
- Making data hard to read
- Using secure keys

# Question 2: What is a straem cipher?
- Encrypts data in a waves
- Uses a block of data
- Encrypts data as it comes in to the stream (*)
- Uses a different chining mode

# Question 3: What is a block cipher?
- Uses blocks of padded data to cipher (*)
- Uses data as it becomes available
- Makes data secure for only compression
- Uses the alternating bits in a blocks
