# Question 1: What are generics?
- Async values
- Classes without types
- Classes that can use multiple types (*)
- Classes that use only numbers

# Question 2: Where can generics can be used
- Only in classes
- Only in functions
- In classes and functions (*)
- In functions and only in abstract classes

# Question 3: Why use generics
- Code speed
- Code re-use (*)
- Code completion
- Code validation

# Question 4: What is the common problem with generics
- Only one type can be used
- Only on generic per function is allowed
- Code speed is reduced
- code complexity increses (*)
